Release Notes
=============

R2-3 (20-February-2017)
----
* Added new record Energy.  This is used to tell camserver the actual x-ray energy being used,
  which is important for proper flat-field corrections.  Previously it was assumed that camserver
  was setting the energy to 2*ThresholdEnergy. There are 2 problems with this
  - Sometimes it is desireable to set the threshold to a value which is different from Energy/2.
  - camserver is always supposed to set the energy to 2*EnergyThreshold if the energy is not 
    specified.  However, some versions of camserver have a bug and they do not do this unless the
    energy has been explicitly set at least once.  The driver now always sends the energy value to
    camserver.  If the Energy record is set to 0 then the driver will send the 2*ThresholdEnergy
    to camserver for the energy.
* If camserver is saving TIFF files then the driver now reads the TIFFImageDescription tag from the
  TIFF file.  This is a long string that camserver writes to the file containing all of the detector
  settings, including threshold, energy, etc.  The driver adds this information to the NDArray using
  an NDAttribute called TIFFImageDescription.  The NDFileTIFF plugin in ADCore R2-6 was changed to
  write this complete attribute to the TIFFImageDescription tag in the new TIFF file.  
  It will also be written by the NDFileNetCDF, NDFileHDF5, and NDFileNexus plugins.  However these 
  plugins are currently limited to 256 character string attributes, so some of the information will
  be lost because the string is longer than 256 characters.
* Added PhiIncr, ChiIncr, Omega and OmegaIncr to pilatusAncillary.adl medm screen and pilatus_settings.req.

R2-2 (13-September-2015)
----
* Fix to allow exposure times less than 1e-6 seconds.
* Add new records: PhiIncr, ChiIncr, Omega and OmegaIncr
  which are suppported in camserver version: tvx-7.3.13-121212b
* Added Dectris user manuals to documentation directory


R2-1 (16-April-2015)
----
* Changes for compatibility with ADCore R2-2.


R2-0 (4-April-2014)
----
* Moved the repository to [Github](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPilatus).
* Re-organized the directory structure to separate the driver library from the example IOC application.
* Increased timeout when setting threshold from 90 to 110 seconds. 
  Needed on 6M with new camserver. Thanks to Lewis Muir.
* Changed the code that reads the temperature and humidiy from running in a separate thread in the driver
  to being called via the standard ReadStatus record from ADBase.template.

R1-9-1 and earlier
